## Technical Architecture Enhancements

### Performance Optimization Strategy

#### 1. Query Optimization
```python
# Implement query result caching
class QueryCache:
    def __init__(self, ttl: int = 3600):
        self.cache = {}
        self.ttl = ttl

    def get_or_execute(self, query_hash: str, executor: callable):
        # Implement intelligent caching with TTL
        pass

# Add query plan analysis
class QueryOptimizer:
    def analyze_execution_plan(self, query: str) -> ExecutionPlan:
        # Analyze query performance and suggest optimizations
        pass
```

#### 2. Memory Management
```python
# Implement streaming data processing
class StreamingProcessor:
    def __init__(self, chunk_size: int = 10000):
        self.chunk_size = chunk_size

    def process_large_dataset(self, query: str) -> Iterator[pd.DataFrame]:
        # Process data in chunks to avoid memory exhaustion
        pass
```

#### 3. Connection Pool Optimization
```python
# Enhanced connection pooling
class EnterpriseConnectionPool:
    def __init__(self,
                 min_connections: int = 5,
                 max_connections: int = 50,
                 health_check_interval: int = 30):
        # Implement intelligent connection management
        pass

    def get_connection(self, priority: str = "normal") -> Connection:
        # Priority-based connection allocation
        pass
```

### Scalability Architecture
